# Distribute

Tauri provides the tooling you need to distribute your application either to the platform app stores or as platform-specific installers.

## Building

[Section titled “Building”](#building)

Tauri builds your application directly from its CLI via the `build`, `android build` and `ios build` commands.

- [npm](#tab-panel-0-0)
- [yarn](#tab-panel-0-1)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-0-2)
- [deno](#tab-panel-0-3)
- [bun](#tab-panel-0-4)
- [cargo](#tab-panel-0-5)

```
npm run tauri build
```

```
yarn tauri build
```

```
pnpm tauri build
```

```
deno task tauri build
```

```
bun tauri build
```

```
cargo tauri build
```

See the [distributing](#distributing) section to learn more about the configuration options available for each bundle
and how to distribute them to your users.

Note

Most platforms requires code signing. See the [signing](#signing) section for more information.

### Bundling

[Section titled “Bundling”](#bundling)

By default the `build` command automatically bundles your application for the configured formats.

If you need further customization on how the platform bundles are generated, you can split the build and bundle steps:

- [npm](#tab-panel-1-0)
- [yarn](#tab-panel-1-1)
- [pnpm](#tab-panel-1-2)
- [deno](#tab-panel-1-3)
- [bun](#tab-panel-1-4)
- [cargo](#tab-panel-1-5)

```
npm run tauri build -- --no-bundle

# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store

npm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app,dmg

# bundle for App Store distribution

npm run tauri bundle -- --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

```
yarn tauri build --no-bundle

# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store

yarn tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg

# bundle for App Store distribution

yarn tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

```
pnpm tauri build --no-bundle

# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store

pnpm tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg

# bundle for App Store distribution

pnpm tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

```
deno task tauri build --no-bundle

# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store

deno task tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg

# bundle for App Store distribution

deno task tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

```
bun tauri build --no-bundle

# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store

bun tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg

# bundle for App Store distribution

bun tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

```
cargo tauri build --no-bundle

# bundle for distribution outside the macOS App Store

cargo tauri bundle --bundles app,dmg

# bundle for App Store distribution

cargo tauri bundle --bundles app --config src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json
```

## Versioning

[Section titled “Versioning”](#versioning)

Your application version can be defined in the [`tauri.conf.json > version`](/reference/config/#version) configuration option,
which is the recommended way for managing the app version. If that config value is not set,
Tauri uses the `package > version` value from your `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` file instead.

Note

Some platforms have some limitations and special cases for the version string.
See the individual distribution documentation pages for more information.

## Signing

[Section titled “Signing”](#signing)

Code signing enhances the security of your application by applying a digital signature to your
application’s executables and bundles, validating your identity of the provider of your application.

Signing is required on most platforms. See the documentation for each platform for more information.

## Distributing

[Section titled “Distributing”](#distributing)

Learn how to distribute your application for each platform.

### Linux

[Section titled “Linux”](#linux)

For Linux you can distribute your app using the Debian package, Snap, AppImage, Flatpak, RPM or Arch User Repository (AUR) formats.

[AppImage](/distribute/appimage/)Distribute as an AppImage

### macOS

[Section titled “macOS”](#macos)

For macOS you can either distribute your application directly to the App Store or ship a DMG installer as direct download.
Both methods requires code signing, and distributing outside the App Store also requires notarization.
