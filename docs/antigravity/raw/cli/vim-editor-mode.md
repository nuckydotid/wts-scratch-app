# Vim editor mode

Edit prompts with modal Vim keybindings instead of the default flat text editor.

Vim editor mode replaces the editing model in every multi-line input surface of the CLI:

| Surface                                                  | What you edit there                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The prompt box                                           | Your message to the agent, including multi-line prompts and slash commands.   |
| The comment editor in [`/diff`](/docs/cli/commands/diff) | Review comments you leave on a changed file.                                  |
| The comment editor in the artifact review panel          | Feedback on a generated [artifact](/docs/cli/artifacts) before you accept it. |

It also adds a `vim` tab to the help overlay and a mode badge to the [status line](/docs/cli/statusline).

## Enable Vim editor mode

Vim editor mode is off by default. Turn it on from the interactive settings panel or directly in `settings.json`.

### Using the settings panel

1.  Type `/settings` inside the prompt panel and press `Enter`.

2.  Navigate to **Editor Mode** using `↑`/`↓`.

3.  Press `Enter` to select `vim`.

4.  Set **Editor Mode › Insert First** to choose which mode each prompt starts in. Leave it `off` to start in Normal mode, or set it `on` to start in Insert mode with a bare `Enter` that submits. See [Start in Insert mode](#start-in-insert-mode).

5.  Press `Esc` to save and close the editor.

### Using `settings.json`

Set `editorMode` in your configuration profile:

```
{
    "editorMode": "vim",
    "vimInsertFirst": false
}
```

The CLI loads this file from `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` at startup. `editorMode` accepts `"default"` and `"vim"`. `vimInsertFirst` controls which mode each new prompt starts in and applies only when `editorMode` is `"vim"`; see [Start in Insert mode](#start-in-insert-mode).

> **Note:** `editorMode` is unrelated to the [`editor` setting](/docs/cli/settings). `editor` picks the external program that `Ctrl+G` launches, so setting `editor` to `"vim"` opens Vim in a separate window and does nothing to the prompt. `editorMode` is the one that controls modal editing inside the CLI prompt itself.

## Switch between modes

Vim editor mode starts in NORMAL. Press `i` to type, and `Esc` to return to NORMAL.

| Command         | Action                                  | From mode      |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| `Esc`, `Ctrl+C` | Enter NORMAL mode                       | INSERT, VISUAL |
| `i`             | Insert before the cursor                | NORMAL         |
| `I`             | Insert at the first non-blank character | NORMAL         |
| `a`             | Insert after the cursor                 | NORMAL         |
| `A`             | Insert at the end of the line           | NORMAL         |
| `o`             | Open a line below and insert            | NORMAL         |
| `O`             | Open a line above and insert            | NORMAL         |
| `v`             | Start a character-wise selection        | NORMAL         |
| `V`             | Start a line-wise selection             | NORMAL         |

The status line reports the current mode:

| Mode        | Badge          |
| :---------- | :------------- |
| NORMAL      | none           |
| INSERT      | `-- INSERT --` |
| VISUAL      | `-- VISUAL --` |
| VISUAL LINE | `-- V-LINE --` |

An empty badge area means you are in NORMAL mode. If you run a [custom status line](#show-the-mode-in-a-custom-status-line), it replaces this badge unless you stack it with the default.

> **Tip:** Press `?` in NORMAL mode to open the shortcuts overlay, or run `/help` and select the `vim` tab for a full cheat sheet.

## Submit your prompt

Enter behaves differently in each mode, so you can compose multi-line prompts without accidental submits.

| Context                      | `Enter`          | `Ctrl+S` / `Ctrl+Enter` | `ZZ`   |
| :--------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------- | :----- |
| NORMAL mode                  | Submit           | Submit                  | Submit |
| INSERT mode                  | Insert a newline | Submit                  | —      |
| INSERT mode, insert-first on | Submit           | Submit                  | —      |

`ZZ` submits from NORMAL and VISUAL mode, matching the muscle memory of writing and quitting a buffer.

### Start in Insert mode

Set `vimInsertFirst` when you want each new prompt to begin in INSERT mode with a bare `Enter` that submits. This keeps the default typing experience while leaving NORMAL mode one `Esc` away.

```
{
    "editorMode": "vim",
    "vimInsertFirst": true
}
```

The **Editor Mode › Insert First** option appears in `/settings` only when Editor Mode is set to `vim`. It has no effect in default mode.

## Move the cursor

All motions work on their own in NORMAL and VISUAL mode, and as targets for an operator.

| Key                 | Motion                                                    |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h` `l`             | Left, right                                               |
| `j` `k`             | Down, up                                                  |
| `0` `$`             | Start of line, end of line                                |
| `^`                 | First non-blank character on the line                     |
| `w` `b` `e`         | Next word, previous word, end of word                     |
| `W` `B` `E`         | Same, treating whitespace-delimited chunks as words       |
| `gg` `G`            | Start of input, end of input                              |
| `f{char}` `F{char}` | Jump onto the next or previous `{char}`                   |
| `t{char}` `T{char}` | Stop one character short of the next or previous `{char}` |
| `;` `,`             | Repeat the last `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` forward, backward         |

## Edit text

Editing commands fall into three groups: single keys that act immediately, operators that wait for a motion, and text objects that select a delimited region.

### Single-key commands

| Key       | Action                                                       |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `x`       | Delete the character under the cursor                        |
| `r{char}` | Replace the character under the cursor with `{char}`         |
| `D` `C`   | Delete or change from the cursor to the end of the line      |
| `o` `O`   | Open a new line below or above and enter INSERT mode         |
| `p` `P`   | Paste after or before the cursor                             |
| `u` `U`   | Undo, redo. `Ctrl+R` does not redo; it opens artifact review |

Commands take no count prefix, so `3dd` deletes one line. To act on several lines at once, select them with `V` and press the operator. There is also no `.` to repeat the last change.

There is one unnamed register rather than the usual `"a`–`"z` set. Deletes fill it, so `x`, `D`, `C`, `d`, and `c` all leave text you can paste back with `p`.

Paste is linewise-aware. Text yanked with `dd` or `yy` pastes onto a new line below (`p`) or above (`P`). Anything else pastes inline.

### Operators and motions

Combine an operator with any motion to act on the span it covers.

| Operator | Action                                  | Word forms     | Whole line |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------- | :--------- |
| `d`      | Delete                                  | `dw` `de` `db` | `dd`       |
| `c`      | Change (delete, then enter INSERT mode) | `cw` `ce` `cb` | `cc`       |
| `y`      | Yank                                    | `yw` `ye` `yb` | `yy`       |

```
dw     Delete to the start of the next word
d$     Delete to the end of the line
c^     Change back to the first non-blank character
yG     Yank to the end of the input
dfx    Delete forward through the next "x"
```

`cw` changes to the end of the current word, matching real Vim.

### Text objects

Pair an operator with `i` (inside) or `a` (around) and a delimiter.

| Object              | Selects                                        |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `iw` `aw`           | A word, with or without surrounding whitespace |
| `iW` `aW`           | A whitespace-delimited chunk                   |
| `i"` `a"` `i'` `a'` | Text in single or double quotes                |
| `i(` `a(` `i)` `a)` | Text in parentheses                            |
| `i[` `a[` `i]` `a]` | Text in square brackets                        |
| `i{` `a{` `i}` `a}` | Text in braces                                 |

Backticks work the same way: pair `i` or `a` with a backtick to select inline code.

```
ci"    Change the text inside the nearest quotes
da(    Delete a parenthesized group, parentheses included
yiw    Yank the word under the cursor
```

## Work with selections

Press `v` or `V` to select, move with any motion, then apply a command. Press `v` or `V` again, or `Esc`, to leave.

| Key       | Action on the selection                        |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `d` `x`   | Delete                                         |
| `c`       | Change                                         |
| `y`       | Yank                                           |
| `r{char}` | Replace every selected character with `{char}` |
| `~`       | Toggle case                                    |
| `u` `U`   | Lowercase, uppercase                           |

> **Note:** `~`, `u`, and `U` change case in VISUAL mode only. In NORMAL mode, `u` and `U` are undo and redo.

## Run slash and shell commands

Press `/` or `!` in NORMAL mode. The CLI inserts the character and switches to INSERT mode, so slash commands and shell commands work without pressing `i` first.

```
/settings     Open the settings panel from NORMAL mode
!ls -la       Run a shell command from NORMAL mode
```

## Customize the submit and newline keys

Three Vim actions are remappable in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/keybindings.json`. These are the defaults:

```
{
    "vim.insert.insert_newline": ["alt+enter", "ctrl+j", "enter", "shift+enter"],
    "vim.insert.submit": ["ctrl+enter", "ctrl+s"],
    "vim.normal.submit": ["ctrl+enter", "ctrl+s"]
}
```

Motions, operators, and text objects are fixed and cannot be remapped.

### Submit with Enter in NORMAL mode only

This is the default. `Enter` submits from NORMAL mode and inserts a newline in INSERT mode, so you can type freely and submit with a single `Esc` `Enter`. No configuration is needed. Leave `vimInsertFirst` off:

```
{
    "editorMode": "vim",
    "vimInsertFirst": false
}
```

### Submit with Enter in INSERT mode too

Move `enter` out of `vim.insert.insert_newline` and into `vim.insert.submit`. `Shift+Enter`, `Alt+Enter`, and `Ctrl+J` still insert newlines:

```
{
    "vim.insert.insert_newline": ["alt+enter", "ctrl+j", "shift+enter"],
    "vim.insert.submit": ["ctrl+enter", "ctrl+s", "enter"]
}
```

Setting `vimInsertFirst` to `true` achieves the same submit behavior without editing keybindings, but it also changes which mode each new prompt starts in.

> **Warning:** `Enter` always submits in NORMAL mode. Remapping `vim.normal.submit` adds keys; it never removes `Enter`.

## Show the mode in a custom status line

A [custom status line](/docs/cli/statusline) replaces the built-in one, and the mode badge goes with it. You have two ways to get the mode back.

Keep the built-in line and stack your script underneath it:

```
{
    "statusLine": {
        "type": "command",
        "command": "~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/statusline.sh",
        "stack_with_default": true
    }
}
```

Or render the mode yourself. When `editorMode` is `"vim"`, the JSON payload piped to your script carries a `vim` object:

```
{
    "vim": {
        "mode": "INSERT"
    }
}
```

`mode` is `NORMAL`, `INSERT`, `VISUAL`, or `VISUAL LINE`. The field is absent entirely when Vim editor mode is off, so a script can use its presence as the enablement check:

```
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)
mode=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.vim.mode // empty')
[ -n "$mode" ] && printf -- '-- %s -- ' "$mode"
echo "$input" | jq -r '.model.display_name'
```

> **Note:** `vim.mode` reports `NORMAL`, unlike the built-in badge, which renders nothing in that mode. A script that prints every mode shows a `-- NORMAL --` badge the built-in line never displays.
